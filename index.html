    <h1>Introduction to the Game...</h1>
    <p>The game features a interface divided into four colorful sections, each representing a different color: red, green, yellow, and blue. The objective is simple yet challenging â€“ players must repeat an ever-increasing pattern of colors and sounds produced by the game. They must remember the sequence for the flow.</p>
    <h2>All The Best!!</h2>
